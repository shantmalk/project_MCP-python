## Overview

This document contains results from applying the __minimum-cost path__ method to determine the myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) distal to coronary artery lesions using cardiac CT angiography.  This document used patient image datasets from the CONFRIM study.  Patients in the CONFIRM study were suspected of having CAD, and underwent cardiac CT angiography imaging.  Each patient was followed for ~ 2 years for occurence of major adverse cardiac events.  The CONFIRM study was a multicenter, international study.  The imaging system used for data acquisition was site-specific and therefore variable.  Patietns often had multiple coroanry lesions found on cardiac CT angiography.

### Terms
- Aims assessed both absolute and relative MMAR
	- MMAR was calculated using the minimum-cost path technique with previously acquired cardiac CT angiography (CTA) images
	- Absolute MMAR calculated in grams
	- Relative MMAR calculated as Absolute MMAR / left ventricle mass (g) * 100
- Myocardial infarction (MI) was defined as occurence of STEMI, NSTEMI, or unstable angina
- __Culprit lesion__ defined using either invasive coronary angiography (if available) or cardiac CT angiography
	- Invasive coronary angiography was used to verify the culprit lesion in _most_ patients who had a MI
		- Patients who had a MI, but did not have a culprit lesion defined, were __excluded__ from current analysis
	- CTA was used to determine the likely culprit lesion, using the minimum lumen diameter, in patients who did __not__ have a MI

## Methods
### General
A subselection of patients from the CONFIRM study were used for this analysis.  Particularly patients with and without myocardial infarction (MI) were assessed.  Myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) was determined and analyzed retrospectively.

### Myocardial Mass at-Risk using the Minimum-Cost Path Method
Myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) was defined as the mass or volume of myocardium distal to a coronary artery lesion.  CTA images were used to calculate MMAR using the minimum-cost path method.  The minimum-cost path uses coronary centerlines and a mask of the left ventricle myocardium to generate coronary perfusion territories.  

In patients with multiple CTAs, the CTA image with the most cranio-caudal coverage.  If cranio-caudal coverage was equivalent, the CTA with the most coronary opacification was chosen.  Coronary artery centerlines and left ventricle myocardium were semi-automatically segmented from the chosen CTA image, using a Vitrea workstation.

Vessel branches were grouped into main coronary artery trees for the left anterior descending, left circumflex and right coronary arteries (LAD, LCx, and RCA, respectively).  Then LAD, LCx, and RCA perfusion territories were determined using the minimum-cost path technique.  Lesions previously determined from the CONFIRM study were localized to LAD, LCx and RCA centerlines by using the recorded distance between the minimum lumen diameter and coronary ostium.  The distance between the minimum lumen diameter and coronary ostium for each coronary lesion was determined seperately by a different user in the CONFIRM study.  Each lesion was used to split the main coronary artery tree into 


### Aim 1 and 2
__Aims 1__ and __2__ used the same patient subselection.  53 patients with MI and 53 patients without MI were selected.  Patients were matched using a previously determined propensity score, determined for a separate study.  10 patients from the MI group did not have a defined culprit lesion on invasive coronary angiography and were subsequently excluded from the results.  All patients underwent coronary CT angiography.  Patients with MI underwent invasive coronary angiography at the time of MI.  Patients without MI did not undergo invasive coronary angiography.

In patients with MI, invasive coronary angiography was used to determine the culprit coronary artery lesion (Lesion<sub>ICA</sub>).  In patients without MI, the "worst" coronary artery lesion was determined using coronary CT angiography.  Specifically, the lesion with smallest minimal lumen diameter was used to select the "worst" coronary artery lesion (Lesion<sub>CTA</sub>).

For Aim 1, patients were stratified into MI and non-MI groups.  For Aim 2, patients were stratified into types of MI (STEMI, NSTEMI, unstable angina, and no MI).

The extent of myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) distal to Lesion<sub>ICA</sub> and Lesion<sub>CTA</sub> were compared using box-plot analysis to assess differences in means.  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess for statistical differences between the mean MMAR.  

### Aim 3
__Aim 3__ assessed only patients with MI.  63 patients with MI and at least one identifiable CAD lesion on CTA were analyzed.  Using a CTA image, MMAR was calculated for every identifiable lesion, as previously described.  The culprit lesion was identified using invasive coronary angiography, performed following the onset of MI.  MMAR was calculated distal to every CAD lesion.  All lesions were then separated into culprit and non-culprit groups, and mean MMAR was assessed using box-plot analysis.

__Figure 1: Patient selection criteria for Aim 1.__  Aim 1 sought to compare myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) distal to coronary artery disease (CAD) lesions in patients with and without a myocardial infarction (MI).  The minimum-cost path technique was used to determine MMAR for all lesions in each patient group.  Patients underwent cardiac CT angiography and were followed for two years for Major Adverse Cardiac Events.  (a) Patients with MI underwent invasive coronary angiography (ICA), during which a culprit lesion was verified (Lesion<sub>ICA</sub>).  Lesion<sub>ICA</sub> was then used to calculate MMAR for patients with MI.  (b) In patients without MI, the worst lesion was selected based on assessment using CTA (Lesion<sub>CTA</sub>).  For the results in __Figure 2__, the lesion with the smallest __minimum lumen diameter__ was chosen as Lesion<sub>CTA</sub> in patients without MI.

__Figure 4: Patient selection criteria for Aim 3.__  Aim 3 sought to compare myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) distal to culprit and non-culprit CAD lesions in patients with myocardial infarction (MI).  The minimum-cost path tehcnique was used to determine MMAR for all lesions in patients with MI from the CONFIRM study.  Each patient underwent cardiac CT angiography and were followed for two years for Major Adverse Cardiac Events.  For analysis of Aim 3, only patients with MI were selected based on this two year follow-up.  The culprit lesion was defined as the lesion identified as causing MI, verified on invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and present on CTA.  All other coronary lesions identified on CTA that were not the verified culprit lesion, were categorized as non-culprit lesions.  For analysis in __Figure 5__, 63 patients were selected.  Each patient has 1 culprit lesion.  5 patients did not have additional non-culprit lesions, while the remaining 58 patients had 1 culprit lesion and at least 1 non-culprit lesion identified on CTA.

The culprit lesion was the lesion attributed to causing MI; confirmed using invasive coronary angiography (ICA)* present on cardiac CT angiography (CTA).  For each patient, multiple non-culprit lesions were present.  A non-culprit lesion was any coronary lesion present on CTA, other than the selected culprit lesion.  Absolute myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) was calculated distal to each lesion present for 63 patients with MI.  Lesions were separated into culprit (blue) and non-culprit (red) lesions.  Lesions were further stratified into four groups, ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI), non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI), unstable angina (UA), and undetermined MI type (UND).  __The differences between MMAR distal to culprit versus non-culprit lesions for STEMI, NSTEMI, and UA groups were statistically significant (p-value <.05 using ANOVA).__

_*Invasive coronary angiography was performed at time of MI_

_Relative MMAR:_  Relative myocardial mass at-risk calculated by applying the minimum-cost path technique to cardiac CT angiography images and normalizing to the respective patient's left ventricle myocardial mass

_ICA:_  Invasive coronary angiography

_MI:_  Myocardial infarction, defined as ST-elevation MI, non-ST-elevation MI, or unstable angina

_CTA:_  Cardiac CT angiography

_STEMI:_  ST-segment elevation MI

_NSTEMI:_ Non-ST-segment elevation MI

_UA:_  Unstable angina

_UND:_ Undetermined MI type

__Figure 8A:  Mean CSA of terminal branches in LAD, LCx and RCA trees.__
Mean cross-sectional area (CSA) of terminal branches for main coronary artery trees were calculated.  Terminal branches were defined as branches _without_ any daughter branches.

Depth of terminal branches for main coronary artery trees were calculated.  Terminal branches were defined as branches _without_ any daughter branches.  Depth was defined as the generation branch.
