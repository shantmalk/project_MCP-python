## Overview

This document contains results from applying the __minimum-cost path__ method to determine the myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) distal to coronary artery lesions using cardiac CT angiography.  This document used patient image datasets from the CONFRIM study.  Patients in the CONFIRM study were suspected of having CAD, and underwent cardiac CT angiography imaging.  Each patient was followed for ~ 2 years for occurence of major adverse cardiac events.  The CONFIRM study was a multicenter, international study.  The imaging system used for data acquisition was site-specific and therefore variable.  Patietns often had multiple coroanry lesions found on cardiac CT angiography.

## Aims
### 1.  Is extent of MMAR distal to a patient's __culprit lesion__ predictive of myocardial infarction (MI)
- Processing summary [__(Figure 1)__](#figure-1a)
- Box plot of MMAR for MI and non-MI groups [__(Figures 2A-2D)__](#figure-2A)
- Receiver operator characteristic curve of prognostic value of MMAR in predicting MI [__(Figure 2E)__](#figure-2e)
- Kaplan-Meier survival curve of MMAR versus MI [__(Figure 2F)__](#figure-2f)

### 2.  Is extent of MMAR distal to a patient's __culprit lesion__ predictive of STEMI, NSTEMI, or unstable angina MI types?
- Processing summary is same as _Aim 1_ [__(Figure 1)__](#figure-1a)
	- Patients with MI were further stratified into ST-elevation MI, non-ST-elevation MI, and unstable angina groups
- Box plot of MMAR with patients stratified by MI type [__(Figures 3A-3D)__](#figure3A)

### 3.  Is there a significant difference in extent of MMAR distal to culprit versus non-culprit lesions in patients with MI?
- Processing summary [__(Figure 4)__](#figure-4)
- Box plot of 


### Terms
- Aims assessed both absolute and relative MMAR
	- MMAR was calculated using the minimum-cost path technique with previously acquired cardiac CT angiography (CTA) images
	- Absolute MMAR calculated in grams
	- Relative MMAR calculated as Absolute MMAR / left ventricle mass (g) * 100
- Myocardial infarction (MI) was defined as occurence of STEMI, NSTEMI, or unstable angina
- __Culprit lesion__ defined using either invasive coronary angiography (if available) or cardiac CT angiography
	- Invasive coronary angiography was used to verify the culprit lesion in _most_ patients who had a MI
		- Patients who had a MI, but did not have a culprit lesion defined, were __excluded__ from current analysis
	- CTA was used to determine the likely culprit lesion, using the minimum lumen diameter, in patients who did __not__ have a MI

__Figure 1: Patient selection criteria for Aim 1.__  Aim 1 sought to compare myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) distal to coronary artery disease (CAD) lesions in patients with and without a myocardial infarction (MI).  The minimum-cost path technique was used to determine MMAR for all lesions in each patient group.  Patients underwent cardiac CT angiography and were followed for two years for Major Adverse Cardiac Events.  (a) Patients with MI underwent invasive coronary angiography (ICA), during which a culprit lesion was verified (Lesion<sub>ICA</sub>).  Lesion<sub>ICA</sub> was then used to calculate MMAR for patients with MI.  (b) In patients without MI, the worst lesion was selected based on assessment using CTA (Lesion<sub>CTA</sub>).  For the results in __Figure 2__, the lesion with the smallest __minimum lumen diameter__ was chosen as Lesion<sub>CTA</sub> in patients without MI.

__Figure 4: Patient selection criteria for Aim 3.__  Aim 3 sought to compare myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) distal to culprit and non-culprit CAD lesions in patients with myocardial infarction (MI).  The minimum-cost path tehcnique was used to determine MMAR for all lesions in patients with MI from the CONFIRM study.  Each patient underwent cardiac CT angiography and were followed for two years for Major Adverse Cardiac Events.  For analysis of Aim 3, only patients with MI were selected based on this two year follow-up.  The culprit lesion was defined as the lesion identified as causing MI, verified on invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and present on CTA.  All other coronary lesions identified on CTA that were not the verified culprit lesion, were categorized as non-culprit lesions.  For analysis in __Figure 5__, 63 patients were selected.  Each patient has 1 culprit lesion.  5 patients did not have additional non-culprit lesions, while the remaining 58 patients had 1 culprit lesion and at least 1 non-culprit lesion identified on CTA.

There is one culprit lesion per patient assessed.  The culprit lesion was the lesion attributed to causing MI; confirmed using invasive coronary angiography (ICA)* present on cardiac CT angiography (CTA).  For each patient, multiple non-culprit lesions were present.  A non-culprit lesion was any coronary lesion present on CTA, other than the selected culprit lesion.  Absolute myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) was calculated distal to each lesion present for 63 patients with MI.  Lesions were separated into culprit (blue) and non-culprit (red) lesions.  __The differences between MMAR distal to culprit versus non-culprit lesions was statistically significant (p-value <.05 using ANOVA).__
