## Overview

This document contains results from applying the __minimum-cost path__ method to determine the myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) distal to coronary artery lesions using cardiac CT angiography.  This document used patient image datasets from the CONFRIM study.  Patients in the CONFIRM study were suspected of having CAD, and underwent cardiac CT angiography imaging.  Each patient was followed for ~ 2 years for occurence of major adverse cardiac events.  The CONFIRM study was a multicenter, international study.  The imaging system used for data acquisition was site-specific and therefore variable.  Patietns often had multiple coroanry lesions found on cardiac CT angiography.

## Aims
### 1. Is extent of MMAR distal to a patient's __culprit lesion__ predictive of myocardial infarction (MI)
- Processing summary [__(Figure 1)__](#figure-1a)
- Box plot of MMAR for MI and non-MI groups [__(Figures 2A-2D)__](#figure-2A)
- Receiver operator characteristic curve of prognostic value of MMAR in predicting MI [__(Figure 2E)__](#figure-2e)
- Kaplan-Meier survival curve of MMAR versus MI [__(Figure 2F)__](#figure-2f)

### 2. Is there a significant difference between MMAR<sub>MCP</sub> distal to culprit lesions verified using ICA and non-culprit lesions, in patients who had MI
- Box plot of MMAR for culprit versus non-culprit lesions in patients who had MI __(Figure 4)__

### 3. Is there a significant difference between MMAR<sub>MCP</sub> distal to culprit lesions verified on ICA versus the "worst" lesion determined with CTA
- Box plot of MMAR for culprit lesions verified on ICA versus the "worst" lesion determined with CTA in patients who had MI __(Figure 5)__


### Terms
- Aims assessed both absolute and relative MMAR
	- MMAR was calculated using the minimum-cost path technique with previously acquired cardiac CT angiography (CTA) images
	- Absolute MMAR calculated in grams
	- Relative MMAR calculated as Absolute MMAR / left ventricle mass (g) * 100
- Myocardial infarction (MI) was defined as occurence of STEMI, NSTEMI, or unstable angina
- __Culprit lesion__ defined using either invasive coronary angiography (if available) or cardiac CT angiography
	- Invasive coronary angiography was used to verify the culprit lesion in _most_ patients who had a MI
		- Patients who had a MI, but did not have a culprit lesion defined, were __excluded__ from current analysis
	- CTA was used to determine the likely culprit lesion, using the minimum lumen diameter, in patients who did __not__ have a MI

## Figures
### Aim 1
Is extent of MMAR distal to a patient's __culprit lesion__ predictive of myocardial infarction (MI)

#### Figure 1:

__Figure 1: Patient selection criteria for Aim 1.__  Aim 1 sought to compare myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) distal to CAD lesions in patients with and without a myocardial infarction (MI).  The minimum-cost path technique was used to determine MMAR for all lesions in each patient group.  Patients underwent cardiac CT angiography and were followed for two years for Major Adverse Cardiac Events.  (a) Patients with MI underwent invasive coronary angiography (ICA), during which a culprit lesion was verified (Lesion<sub>ICA</sub>).  Lesion<sub>ICA</sub> was then used to calculate MMAR for patients with MI.  (b) In patients without MI, the worst lesion was selected based on assessment using CTA (Lesion<sub>CTA</sub>).  For the results in __Figure 2__, the lesion with the smallest __minimum lumen diameter__ was chosen as Lesion<sub>CTA</sub> in patients without MI.

Patients from the CONFIRM study were split into two groups, patients with and without myocardial infarction (MI).  Absolute myocardial mass at-risk (absolute MMAR) was assessed in this figure.  For patients with MI (blue), the culprit lesion verified with invasive coronary angiography* was used to calculate MMAR from the cardaic CT angiography (CTA) acquired prior to MI event.  For patients without MI (red), the lesion with the smallest minimal lumen diameter was selected to calculate MMAR.

__Figure 2B:  Box plot of relative MMAR of MI and no MI groups.__
Patients from the CONFIRM study were split into two groups, patients with and without myocardial infarction (MI).  Relative myocardial mass at-risk (relative MMAR) was assessed in this figure, by normalizing absolute MMAR to respective patients' left ventricle mass.  For patients with MI (blue), the culprit lesion verified with invasive coronary angiography* was used to calculate MMAR from the cardaic CT angiography (CTA) acquired prior to MI event.  For patients without MI (red), the lesion with the smallest minimal lumen diameter was selected to calculate MMAR.  __Differences between relative MMAR between MI (blue) and no MI (red) groups was statistically significant (p-value <.05).__

__Figure 2C:  Box plot of abosulte MMAR of MI and no MI groups, stratified by main coronary lesion location.__
Patients from the CONFIRM study were split into two groups, patients with and without myocardial infarction (MI).  MI and no MI groups were stratified based on location of selected coronary lesion in either the left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCx) or right coronary artery (RCA).  Absolute MMAR was assessed in this figure.  For patients with MI (blue), the culprit lesion verified with invasive coronary angiography* was used to calculate MMAR from the cardaic CT angiography (CTA) acquired prior to MI event.  For patients without MI (red), the lesion with the smallest minimal lumen diameter was selected to calculate MMAR.
