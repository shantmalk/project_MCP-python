## Overview

This document contains results from applying the __minimum-cost path__ method to determine the myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) distal to coronary artery lesions using cardiac CT angiography.  This document used patient image datasets from the CONFRIM study.  Patients in the CONFIRM study were suspected of having CAD, and underwent cardiac CT angiography imaging.  Each patient was followed for ~ 2 years for occurence of major adverse cardiac events.  The CONFIRM study was a multicenter, international study.  The imaging system used for data acquisition was site-specific and therefore variable.  Patietns often had multiple coroanry lesions found on cardiac CT angiography.

## Aims
### 1. Is extent of MMAR<sub>MCP</sub> distal to a patient's __culprit lesion__ predictive of myocardial infarction (MI)
- Processing summary for Aim 1 __(Figure 1)__
- Box plot of MMAR<sub>MCP</sub> for MI and non-MI groups __(Figure 2)__

### 2. Is there a significant difference between MMAR<sub>MCP</sub> distal to culprit lesions verified using ICA and non-culprit lesions, in patients who had MI
- Box plot of MMAR<sub>MCP</sub> for culprit versus non-culprit lesions in patients who had MI __(Figure 4)__

### 3. Is there a significant difference between MMAR<sub>MCP</sub> distal to culprit lesions verified on ICA versus the "worst" lesion determined with CTA
- Box plot of MMAR<sub>MCP</sub> for culprit lesions verified on ICA versus the "worst" lesion determined with CTA in patients who had MI __(Figure 5)__


### Terms
- Aims assessed both absolute and relative MMAR<sub>MCP</sub>
	- Absolute MMAR (MMAR<sub>MCP (abs)</sub>) calculated in grams
	- Relative MMAR (MMAR<sub>MCP (rel)</sub>) calculated as MMAR<sub>MCP (abs)</sub> / left ventricle mass (g) * 100
- MI was defined as occurence of STEMI, NSTEMI, or unstable angina
- __Culprit lesion__ defined using either invasive coronary angiography (if available) or cardiac CT angiography
	- Invasive coronary angiography was used to verify the culprit lesion in _most_ patients who had a MI
		- Patients who had a MI, but did not have a culprit lesion defined, were __excluded__ from current analysis
	- Cardiac CT angiography was used to determine the likely culprit lesion, using the minimum lumen diameter, in patients who did __not__ have a MI
- __Total MMAR<sub>MCP</sub>__ defined as the sum of MMAR<sub>MCP</sub> in each patient

__Figure 1: Patient selection criteria for Aim 1.__  Aim 1 sought to compare myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR) distal to CAD lesions in patients with and without a myocardial infarction (MI).  The minimum-cost path technique was used to determine MMAR for all lesions in each patient group.  Patients underwent cardiac CT angiography and were followed for 2 years for Major Adverse Cardiac Events.  (a) Patients who had a MI, usually underwent invasive coronary angiography, during which a culprit lesion was verified.  This culprit lesion was selected for analysis in Aim 1.  (b) In patients who did not have a MI, the lesion with the smallest minimum lumen diameter, based on cardiac CT angiography, was selected for analysis.

__Figure 2A:  Box plot of MMAR<sub>MCP (abs)</sub> of MI and no MI groups.__
Patients from the CONFIRM study were split into two groups, patients with and without myocardial infarction (MI).  Absolute myocardial mass at-risk was assessed in this figure.  For patients with MI (blue), the culprit lesion verified with invasive coronary angiography* was used to calculate myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR<sub>MCP</sub>) from the cardaic CT angiography (CTA) acquired prior to MI event.  For patients without MI (red), the lesion with the smallest minimal lumen diameter was selected to calculate MMAR<sub>MCP</sub>.

Patients from the CONFIRM study were split into two groups, patients with and without myocardial infarction (MI).  Relative myocardial mass at-risk was assessed in this figure, by normalizing absolute myocardial mass at-risk to respective patients left ventricle mass.  For patients with MI (blue), the culprit lesion verified with invasive coronary angiography* was used to calculate myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR<sub>MCP</sub>) from the cardaic CT angiography (CTA) acquired prior to MI event.  For patients without MI (red), the lesion with the smallest minimal lumen diameter was selected to calculate MMAR<sub>MCP</sub>.

Patients from the CONFIRM study were split into two groups, patients with and without myocardial infarction (MI).  MI and no MI groups were stratified based on location of selected coronary lesion in either the left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCx) or right coronary artery (RCA).  Absolute myocardial mass at-risk was assessed in this figure.  For patients with MI (blue), the culprit lesion verified with invasive coronary angiography* was used to calculate myocardial mass at-risk (MMAR<sub>MCP</sub>) from the cardaic CT angiography (CTA) acquired prior to MI event.  For patients without MI (red), the lesion with the smallest minimal lumen diameter was selected to calculate MMAR<sub>MCP</sub>.
